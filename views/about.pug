            | Hi! My name is Otavio Araujo. I`m from Brazil but I am currently living in Ireland. I have been interested in technology since I was a kid, but only at 28 years of age
            | I have made the decision to learn how to program as a hobby. It so happens that this hobby turned into passion, and I decided to start a more structured course in JavaScript
            | and one year later this passion took over my life and I quit in my job as a General Dentist and Orthodontist in Brazil and moved to Ireland to sharpen my english skills and
            | to be able to dedicate myself to coding and making a career out of it. I'm almost 31 now and it has been a beautiful journey so far. Since I moved here I was able to reach C1 (advanced)
            | level in English and with a lot of hard work I am now capable of develop backend and frontend application using HTML+CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Express and SQL databases.
            | My main focus now is to get better and better at web develoment and to start to contribute to a company's growth with my work.
