# static_node_and_express_site
My portfolio website built with Node.js, Express and Pug.

This website is my personal portfolio and showcases some of my projects
as a Full-stack JavaScript developer. The portfololio itself is a project
that was accomplished using Node, Express and Pug. The projects contained
here demonstrate work using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX and more.

There are a few dependencies needed to run this website, and they can be
attained running "npm install".

To use the website run "npm start".
